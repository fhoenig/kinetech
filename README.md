Kinetech Sandbox v0.1
=====================

Web based sandbox environment for 2D rigid body humanoid motion/dance art and more.

Develop
-------

Just fork and clone the repository and point a static webserver at the 
public directory. There is no server side scripting and the application runs
exclusively on the client.

A publicly hosted version can be found here [Sandbox](http://kinetech.org)

Roadmap
-------

Yeah...It's a beautiful mess. There is a lot to be done.
I'd personally port everything to Meteor next and add server-side persistence of sorts.
A WebGL fragment program based renderer is high up on the list as well ;-)

The character featured in this sandbox has performed live in a duet with and choreographed by
[Karla Johanna Quintero](http://karlajohannaquintero.tumblr.com/) at Kunst-stoff arts and a lot of 
the code used still remains inside this repository.
Check out [Kinetech Arts](https://www.facebook.com/kinetechlab) for context.

Special thanks to Weidong Yang and Diane Lopez, who are hosting an environment 
for dance artists and technologists.
